# Template for Classification


There are three files here:

* `train.py`: the main code file, outlines the entire training process.
* `train.yaml`: the hyperparameters file, sets all parameters of execution.
* `custom_model.py`: A file containing the definition of a PyTorch module.

To train the classification model, just execute the following on the command-line:

```bash
python train.py train.yaml
```
